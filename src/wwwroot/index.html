</h1>

<p>
    <em>#Script</em> is a <a href="/docs/introduction#simplicity-end-to-end">simple</a>, fast, highly versatile and
    embeddable scripting language for .NET Core and .NET Apps that utilizes a 
    <a href="/docs/syntax">familiar expressive Syntax</a> 
    to enable dynamic scripting of .NET Apps via controlled access to pluggable 
    <a href="/docs/methods">methods</a> and <a href="/docs/arguments">arguments</a>
    within a sandbox environment - ensuring scripts are encapsulated and developed using clean, reusable and testable components. 
</p>

<h5 id="language">Language</h5>

<p>
    The language itself a familiar combination of
    <a href="/docs/expression-viewer">JavaScript expressions</a> contained within Template Expressions popularized in    
    <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/filters.html">Vue.js filters</a> and 
    <a href="https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#template-expression-operators">Angular's Template Expressions</a>
    whilst statements adopt <a href="/docs/blocks">Handlebars block helpers</a> syntax. The language is also highly extensible which is pre-configured
    <a href="/docs/default-scripts">comprehensive suite of safe methods</a> and blocks by default, but are all registered via its 
    rich plugin functionality which can be completely removed or "shadowed" (aka overridden) where it could be used to form the basis of your
    own completely different DSL.
</p>

<h5 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h5>

<p>
    In addition to the language, #Script includes a surrounding ecosystem of rich functionality adapting #Script
    to power a number of fun and exciting scenarios. E.g. Scripts are lazily loaded from its Virtual File System
    which can be configured to use any of the <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system">available Virtual File Systems</a>
    and is what enables <a href="/docs/sharp-apps#pure-cloud-apps">Pure Cloud Apps</a> where <b>entire</b> Sharp Apps could be hosted within
    your AWS S3 Bucket or Azure Blob Storage.
</p>

<h5 id="dynamic">Dynamic</h5>

<p>
    It's small, lightweight footprint and built-in <a href="/docs/hot-reloading">Hot Reloading</a>
    provides a fun, clean and productive alternative to MVC Razor that's easily 
    <a href="/docs/sharp-pages">integrated into any web framework</a> and runs identically in 
    <a href="/docs/sharp-pages#runs-everywhere">every platform ServiceStack runs on</a>, as well as
    within <a href="/docs/mvc-aspnet">ASP.NET MVC</a> and <a href="/docs/mvc-aspnet">ASP.NET MVC Core</a> 
    Controllers - in all cases, using the same <a href="/docs/introduction#instant-startup">high-performance implementation</a>    
    to asynchronously write to a forward-only OutputStream for max performance and maximum potential reuse of your Source Code.
</p>

<p>
    #Script scripts are lazily loaded and <a href="/docs/introduction#late-bound">late-bound</a> for Instant Startup, doesn't require any 
    pre-compilation, coupling to any external configuration files, build tools, designer tooling or have any special deployment requirements.
    It can be used as a general purpose scripting or templating language to generate <a href="/docs/page-formats">any text format</a> 
    and includes built-in support for <em>.html</em>.
</p>

<h5 id="encapsulated">Encapsulated</h5>

<p>
    Similar to <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html">Vue.js Components</a>, Sharp Script's are evaluated in an 
    <a href="/docs/sandbox">Encapsulated Sandbox</a> that enables fine-grained control over exactly what functionality and instances 
    are available to different Scripts. They're pre-configured with a comprehensive suite of safe 
    <a href="/docs/default-scripts">Default Scripts</a> which when running in trusted contexts can easily be granted access to 
    <a href="/docs/filters-reference">enhanced functionality</a>.
</p>

<h5 id="simple">Simple</h5>

<p>
    #Script is designed to be incrementally adoptable where its initial form is
    <a href="/docs/sharp-apps#ideal-for-web-designers-and-content-authors">ideal for non-programmers</a>, 
    that can gradually adopt more power and functionality when needed where they can leverage existing Services or MVC Controllers 
    to enable an 
    <a href="/docs/model-view-controller">MVC programming model</a> or have <em>.html</em> pages upgraded to use 
    <a href="/docs/code-pages">Code Pages</a> where they can utilize the full unlimited power of the C# programming language to 
    enable precise control over the rendering of pages and partials. Code pages take precedence and are interchangeable wherever 
    normal <em>.html</em> pages are requested making them a non-invasive alternative whenever advanced functionality is required.
</p>

<h3>Popular Use Cases</h3>

<p>
    These qualities opens #Script up to a number of new use-cases that's better suited than Razor for maintaining 
    <a href="/usecases/content-websites">content-heavy websites</a>, <a href="/usecases/live-documents">live documents</a>,
    <a href="/usecases/email-templates">Email Templates</a> and can easily 
    <a href="/usecases/introspect-state">introspect the state of running .NET Apps</a> where they provide 
    <a href="/docs/servicestack-scripts#debug-template">valuable insight at a glance</a> with support for 
    <a href="/usecases/adhoc-querying">Adhoc querying</a>.
</p>

<h3>Sharp Apps</h3>

<p>
    One use-case made possible by #Script we're extremely excited about is <a href="/docs/sharp-apps">Sharp Apps</a> - a new approach to 
    dramatically simplify .NET Web App development and provide the most productive development experience possible. 
</p>

<p>
    Sharp Apps leverages #Script to develop entire content-rich, data-driven websites in a pure live development model 
    without needing to write any C#, compile projects or manually refresh pages. Checkout the Spirals Sharp App below 
    for a glimpse of the Live Development experience available:

<p>
    The integrated development experience extends to end-to-end to provide a seamless installation and deployment experience where the 
    same <em>web</em> dotnet tool used to develop Sharp Apps is all users need to find and install Apps locally or hosted as a server App 
    where they're easily deployed and <a href="/docs/deploying-sharp-apps">hosted on Linux or run within Docker</a> -
    the overall Sharp Apps experience results in the easiest and fastest way to develop and deploy Web Apps in .NET!
</p>

<h4>Pure Cloud Apps</h4>

<p>
    Sharp Apps also enable the development of <a href="/docs/sharp-apps#pure-cloud-apps">Pure Cloud Apps</a> where the same SharpApp 
    can be developed and run entirely on <em>AWS S3 and RDS</em> or <em>Azure Blob Storage and SQL Server</em> by just changing
    its <em>app.settings</em>.
