The [web .NET Core tool](https://docs.servicestack.net/web-new) also serve as a `#Script` runner. The Vue and React "lite" project templates
take advantage of this in their [Pre-compiled minified production _bundle.ss script](https://docs.servicestack.net/templates-lite#pre-compiled-minified-production-bundles) 
which is run with `web run {script}`:

    $ dotnet tool install --global web 

    $ web run wwwroot/_bundle.ss

**[Sharp Scripts](/docs/sharp-scripts)** are **run in the same context** and have access to the same functionality and features as a 
[Sharp App](/docs/sharp-apps) including extensibility va [custom plugins](/docs/sharp-apps#plugins). 
They can run **stand-alone** independent of an 
[app.settings](/docs/sharp-apps#ideal-for-web-designers-and-content-authors) config file, instead the app settings configuration
can be added in its page arguments to enable or configure any features.

Lets go through a couple of different possibilities we can do with scripts:

### Adhoc reports

Scripts can use the built-in [Database Scripts](/docs/db-scripts) to be able to [run queries against any](/docs/sharp-apps#multi-platform-configurations) `sqlite`, `sqlserver`, `mysql` and `postgres` database and quickly view data snapshots using the built-in
[HTML Scripts](/docs/html-scripts#htmldump), e.g:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/01.md' | githubMarkdown }}

#### Specifying Script Arguments

The above script generates a static HTML page can be invoked with **any number of named arguments** after the script name, in this case it
generates a report for Northwind Order **#10643**, saves it to `10643.html` and opens it in the OS's default browser:

    $ web run script.html -id 10643 > 10643.html && start 10643.html

Which looks like:

### textDump

Generating static `.html` pages can quickly produce reports that looks good enough to share with others, 
but if you just want to see a snapshot info at a glance or be able to share in text-based mediums like email or chat
channels you can replace `htmlDump` with `textDump` where it will instead output GitHub flavored Markdown tables, e.g:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/02.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
As the output is human-readable we can view directly it without a browser:

    $ web run script.ss -id 10643 

Which will output:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/07.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
And because they're GitHub Flavored Markdown Tables they can be embedded directly in Markdown docs (like this) where it's renders as:
{{/markdown}}

<div class='markdown-body'>
{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/08.md' | githubMarkdown }}
</div>

### AWS Dashboards

The [comprehensive built-in scripts](/docs/default-scripts) coupled with ServiceStack's agnostic 
providers like the [Virtual File System](/virtual-file-system) makes it easy to quickly query infrastructure resources
like all Tables and Row counts in managed AWS RDS Instances or Search for static Asset resources in S3 Buckets.

You can use `$NAME` to move confidential information out of public scripts where it will be replaced with Environment 
Variables. Then run the script as normal and optionally override the `find` pattern for files you want to search for:

    $ web run script-aws.ss -find *.png

Where it displays a dashboard of activity from your AWS resources: containing all Tables with their Row Counts, 
adhoc queries like your last 5 Orders, The Root files and Folders available in your S3 Bucket and any matching resources 
from your `find` search pattern:

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/09.md' | githubMarkdown }}

### Azure Dashboards

The nice thing about `#Script` late-binding and cloud agnostic providers is that with just different configuration we
can **use the exact same script** to query an Azure managed SQL Server Database and Azure Blob File Storage:

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/04.md' | githubMarkdown }}

## Live #Script with 'web watch'

What's even nicer than the fast feedback of running adhoc scripts? Is the instant feedback you get from being able to **"watch"** the same script!

To watch a script just replace `run` with `watch`:

    $ web watch script-aws.ss -find *.png

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/sharpscript/watch-aws-azure.gif)](/docs/sharp-scripts)

The ability to run stand-alone adhoc scripts in an extensible dynamic scripting language feels like you're 
using a "developer enhanced" SQL Studio, where you can combine queries from multiple data sources, [manipulate them with LINQ](https://sharpscript.net/linq/restriction-operators) 
and quickly pipe results to dump utils to combine them in the same output for instant visualization.

`#Script` scripts can also be easily shared, maintained in gists and run on all different Win/OSX/Linux OS's that .NET Core runs on.

### Live Transformations

Another area where "watched" scripts can shine is as a "companion scratch pad" assistant during development that you can quickly switch to
and instantly test out live code fragments, calculations and transformations, e.g. This ends up being a great way to test out markdown syntax
and Nuglify's advanced compression using our new `minifyjs` and `minifycss` [Script Blocks](/docs/blocks):
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/05.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
Then run with:

    $ web watch livepad.ss

Which starts a live watched session that re-renders itself on save, initially with:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/06.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
